Canvas AI – Image Transformation and Enhancement Project


I wanted to introduce you to our latest project, Canvas AI, which is similar to the Sculpt AI concept. Canvas AI uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform and enhance images in unique and creative ways. It has two primary functionalities:

Sketch to Color – This feature allows users to upload a hand-drawn grayscale sketch, which is then automatically transformed into a vibrant, colored image using a dedicated GAN model.

Style Transfer – Users can apply a wide range of artistic styles to their images, giving them a fresh and stylized appearance.

Key Features:
Sketch to Color: Convert hand-drawn sketches into fully colored images.
Style Transfer: Select from various artistic styles to apply to your images.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface ensures accessibility for all users.
Fast and Efficient: Optimized GAN models provide quick processing times.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, React
Backend: Flask
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow
How to Use:
Upload an Image: Choose a sketch for coloring or an image for style transfer.
Select a Model: Choose either the Sketch to Color GAN or the Style Transfer GAN.
Customize: For style transfer, select your desired artistic style.
Download Output: Preview and download the modified image.
